# JRack

A lightweight **Rack** port for the Java Servlet environment, forked from the original [JRack][1].

For more information on **Rack**, visit http://rack.rubyforge.org.

# Building

Checkout the JRack code and cd to that directory.

    git clone git@github.com:florinpatrascu/jrack.git
    cd jrack

    ant dist

The generated jar should be located here: dist/jrack-*.jar

This is work in progress.
